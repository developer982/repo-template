# Guidelines for contributing to the JSON Schema project

## Issues

Issues should identify a problem, enhancement, or use case; and propose some course of action. For alternate support channels, see our [support document](https://github.com/json-schema-org/.github/blob/main/SUPPORT.md).

## Pull requests

We welcome pull requests, both for editorial suggestions and to resolve open issues.

If the pull request would solve a particular issue, reference the issue in the pull request description using a [supported descriptor](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) that will automatically close that issue.

Generally, pull requests should be made to the `main` branch.

Most PRs, will be left open for a minimum of 14 days.  Minor fixes may be merged more quickly once approved by a project member.

## Conduct

All official channels including the mailing list, GitHub organization, Slack server, and IRC channels, follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/json-schema-org/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
